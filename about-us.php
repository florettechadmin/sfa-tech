	  	<p class="text-center">As a part of the SFA group, SFATEC was incorporated in 2004 in the name of SFA TECHNICAL CREATIONS PVT LTD by Jagadish Kumar Chockalingam under the mentorship of Shri Chockalingam Ramasamy, chiefly to manufacture hi-tech & innovative technical textiles.</p>

	  <div class="sfatc">	  	
	  	<p>For more than a decade before the incorporation of SFATEC, Jagadish Kumar Chockalingam had taken up numerous roles within the SFA groupâ€™s different family businesses, in the areas of General Management, Finance, Corporate Planning, Strategy and International Business.</p>
	  	<p>The entrepreneurial spirit of Jagadish Kumar Chockalingam never allowed him to settle for what was easily available to him in his family business. This spirit within him inspired him to travel intensively across the world for more than a decade, looking for new business ideas & innovations, which were absolutely unique and were not available in the Indian and Asian market during that time.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="sfatc1">		  	
	  	<p>The result of this entrepreneurial quest was entering into the manufacture of Protective clothing , Work Wear in 2004, launch of WIEDLER  own brand of Work & Protective Workwear in 2009. Subsequently looking at the market opportunity & to deliver higher value proposition to end customers the Work Wear Rental Business for the Indian market was launched in 2014. Until 2014 SFATEC had been a major supplier of high end technical work wear and protective clothing for leading European brands and Rental Service companies.</p>
	  	<p>Today, SFATEC is the First Indian & Asian Work Wear Rental Service company. The name of the company was changed to SFATEC to make it shorter, simpler and easier for the customers and employees to connect with.</p>
	  	<p>With clarity of thought, a clear business strategy & a truly global vision in place, SFATEC is all set to expand itself without boundaries and attain leadership in the domain of Work Wear Rental Services in India and the rest of the world.</p>
