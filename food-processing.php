	  	<h2>Overview</h2>
	  	<p class="mb10">Under the current scenario the Food Processing Industry in India and rest of the world is going through very stringent product safety regulations. It is also expected that this situation will further intensify because of constant introduction of tougher new set of food safety regulations. Even reputed global companies and brands were forced to pull back food products from shelves which had severely disrupted their brand equity, sales and bottom line by several million dollars. It is very obvious that this will be an endless battle which the food processors and brands cannot forego in the pursuit for supply of safe food products.</p>
	  	<p class="mb20">Considering the public impact on even small amount of contamination into your food products you will be able to see very clearly the ultimate benefit of our Fully Managed Workwear Rental service program.</p>
